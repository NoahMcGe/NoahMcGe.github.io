        <h2>Spanish literature had a high point back in the 16th and 17th century. The writing was about realism, new interests, bright ideas, mighty zeal for religion, and great interest in even older ballads and tales. Around this time more of the Renaissance and religious books started to die, adventure, fantasy, journeys, and rogues battle books begin on the rise. Two of these adventure type of writers were Mateo Aleman and Francisco Gomez. Romance and poetry started adapting the style of Italy using verses and stanzas.</h2>
