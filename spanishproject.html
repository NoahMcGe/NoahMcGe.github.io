        <h2>Spanish literature had a high point back in the 16th and 17th century. The writing was about realism, new interests, bright ideas, mighty zeal for religion, and great interest in even older ballads and tales. Around this time more of the Renaissance and religious books started to die, adventure, fantasy, journeys, and rogues battle books begin on the rise. Two of these adventure type of writers were Mateo Aleman and Francisco Gomez. Romance and poetry started adapting the style of Italy using verses and stanzas.</h2>

	<h2>Spanish authors have a wide variety and diverseness that changes throughout the centuries. Most of the writers of the 16th-17th century were not as popular until they died, in a way you could say they were ahead of their time. Vicente Bacallar born Valencia he moved to Spain and became a Spanish historian and writer. Lope de Vega a man of many titles Spanish playwriter, poet, and novelist. Lope de Vega was born Spain and died Spain all in the same town of Madrid. Lope de Vega was a man who wrote in tragicomic social dramas, I would think that just means relatable dramas.

	<h2>Spanish authors Pedro de Ribadeneira and Miguel de Molinos were both writers religious matters, Pedro being Catholic Miguel being considered a “heretic” by the Catholic church and believed in Quietism. Miguel has a lot of known to his life and what exactly he believed in but it’s speculated that he was a Sodomite. On the flip side, Pedro was accepted by the church and had some merit according to Catholics nowadays and back then. Catholicism has been a big part of Spanish culture every since the Dark Ages when the church was ruling the world. The Catholic church holds nowhere near the power it once had but it still has a hold on the majority of Spanish Countries around the world.

	<h2>American Spanish writers are a little different from the native-born or out of America writers, each country has its own specific taste and way of life which will transcend into people's writing. Spanish writers from America tent to still have the same American jive or attitude there is no real difference in the people who speak English, Spanish, or both in America we all stem from the same country and have a relatively similar environment whether that is Television or schooling. My personal favorite American Spanish writer is Marty Robbins although English is his first langue he has written over 3 whole songs in Spanish. Marty Robbins is a country, western, cowboy, and ballad singer, he is the one who sparked my interest in the Spanish language wanting to truly understand all of his songs and the meaning behind them. The majority of  Marty’s song are in English but he almost always sings about Spanish towns, stories, and their culture. Marty’s most famous song is El Paso El Paso is the border town of Texas and Mexico, “Out in the west Texas town of El Paso I fell in love with a Mexican girl.” is an exert from the first line of the song. Marty’s most famous Spanish song Spanish Lullaby is an amazing short song that truly brings out the nature of Spanish being a “love language”. In every one of his songs he brings out the wonderful Spanish sound from old Spanish music, it has such a heartwarming feeling from the instruments. I could never pick a favorite song as the number one pick but, a great candidate is Buenos Dias Argentina the reason this is such a MASTERPIECE is because of the way he integrates both Spanish and English. I’m sure we can both agree there is nothing better than learning a new language to communicate, learn about others, or make new friends whether your English learning Spanish or Spanish learning English.
